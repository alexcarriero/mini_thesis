                    - `settings.RData` and `table.csv` are used in the 
                       simulation study and store information regarding the 
                       simulation settings and data generating parameters, respectively

                    - `sim_1.rds`, `sim_2.rds` and `sim_3.rds` contain the 
                       empirical results from the simulation study in scenarios 1-3, respectively
